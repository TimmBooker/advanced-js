/**
 * Write a function
 *   callLater(fn, ms);
 * that expects two arguments, a function and time in milliseconds
 *
 * The function will set up the passed fn to be invoked after ms milliseconds
 * It should return a promise that is fulfilled once fn function runs
 * It should reject if the ms delay is 0 or less.   
 * (tip: uses promises and setTimeout)
 *
 * Bonus:
 * Write another function:
 *   callLaterWaterfall(fns, ms);
 * The function expects two arguments, an array of functions and time in ms
 * Upon invokation it will run each function in sequence, with
 * ms milliseconds delay between calls
 * (tip: uses promises, async and await)
